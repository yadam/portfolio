## What is this?

This is a simple web application intended to be a representation of the skill set of a single developer. It's also a place to experiment with new technology and tools in a simple, but fully featured environment.

## What does it do?

The current incarnation of this project is a "Funny or Meh" rating system for [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) comics. It comprises of a front end that displays some dashboard widgets and the latest comic. Two buttons are provided. One rates the comic as "funny". The other rates the comic as "meh". Clicking on one of these buttons records that vote in a database. It also retrieves a random comic for voting. The dashboard widgets will adjust to display voting statistics.
